# Simple Mood Tracker – Project Statement

Problem Statement:
Many individuals struggle to keep track of their emotional well-being on a daily basis.  
Traditional journaling methods are often time-consuming, inconsistent, or difficult to maintain.  
There is a need for a simple, quick, and accessible tool that allows users to log their mood each day without effort.
The **Simple Mood Tracker** aims to solve this problem by providing an easy-to-use desktop application where users can record their daily moods and review their emotional history over time.

Scope of the Project:
This project focuses on creating a **minimal and efficient** mood-tracking application using Python and Tkinter.  
The scope includes:
- Designing a simple GUI for mood selection  
- Saving daily mood entries locally in JSON format  
- Providing options to view today's mood and the full mood history  
- Ensuring the application is easy to run on any computer with Python installed  
The current scope does **not** include complex analytics, cloud storage, or multi-user support, though these can be added in future versions.

Target Users:
The Simple Mood Tracker is ideal for:
- Students wanting a simple emotional logging tool  
- Individuals who want to develop self-awareness and track their feelings
